LCA with distal outcomes

The following files/folders are included in this repository: 

InputFiles (folder) = R code to generate mplus input files. Saves input files for each method in different folder. MplusAutomation library can run batch of input files at once, but only if they are stored in the same folder/file location.

Results_Gather = R code to run batch of mplus input files. Collects and stores results from mplus output files into csv file.

Simulate_data_opt2 = R code to create simulated data. Currently only changing two conditions. Will add more conditions. 


# Note
Simulated data only has two conditions. Will add more conditions. 
Two-Step Method not yet included. Will update all files once code is written. 
Also note that One-Step method current switching classes between runs. Will write code within the Results_Gather.R to rearrange results after each run.
